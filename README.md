# Leetcode in Bend

Bend, so far, is in its infancy, so it is not very easy to use. However, the syntax is very readable, and their logic is quite understandable, so the logical conclusion was to solve different Leetcode problems.

# Format

All leetcode problems are formatted in this way:

*num*.bend, assuming that the code solves only one problem
- Add a ```-num``` to the filename to indicate that the code solves another problem
**NOTE**: The problems will be linked if they are either the same problem, or code that is very similar.
